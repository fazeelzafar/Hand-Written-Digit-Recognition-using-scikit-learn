# Hand-Written-Digit-Recognition-using-scikit-learn

This project was part made during a virtual internship which I was a part of. The tasks that I had to perform were Training a Model, using the digits dataset in scikit-learn, that would predict what those hand-written digits are.

The training model used in this project was Support-Vector Machine, a Supervised Learning model
